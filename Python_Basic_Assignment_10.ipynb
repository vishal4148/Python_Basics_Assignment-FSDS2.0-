    "### 3. What is the difference between the delete functions in the send2trash and shutil modules?\n",
    "Ans: 1) Shutil= module provides a funciton called as shutil.rmtree() which deletes a directory and all its contents. The other functions with similar functionality are os.remove() that removes a file, os.rmdir() removes an empty directory. The problem with these functions are once a file is deleted, it will be lost permanently, if a file is deleted accidentally using these methods there is no way we can recover the deleted file.\n",
    "\n",
    " 2)send2trash= module provides a function called send2trash.send2trash() to delete a file/directory. These methods moves the files/directories to trash folder instead of permanently deleting them, hence if a file/folder is deleted accidentally it can be still recovered from trash folder, if the file is deleted using the send2trash.send2trash() function. send2trash is not included with python standard libary like os & shutil modules, it needs to be installed explicitly using the command !pip install send2trash."
